hi,
thanks for reading this. well this is my first try in making a clone of 
the frontend part of the Zerodha landing page.

just tried my hands and it was good feeling. coding html after this long
was good. well i look forward to just continuing this project.

complete the CSS portion by day 2
& move to the Javascript by day 3.
